# Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5 in Amazon Bedrock: Anthropic’s Smartest Model for Coding & Complex Agents

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is rolling out **Claude Sonnet 4.5** via Amazon Bedrock, enabling developers to tap into one of Anthropic’s most advanced foundation models. This new model builds upon the Claude 4 lineage and is optimized for coding, long-running reasoning, and agentic workflows.

By integrating Sonnet 4.5 into Bedrock, users enjoy a unified API experience, enterprise-grade security, and control over their data, while unlocking advanced capabilities for building intelligent agents.

## Key Features & Differentiators

### Enhanced Coding & Reasoning

- Sonnet 4.5 pushes state-of-the-art performance in coding tasks, with stronger ability to write, refactor, detect bugs, and follow developer instructions.
- It leads in SWE-bench Verified scores, showing better judgment in system design and production-ready code generation.
- The model supports both **instant response mode** and **extended thinking mode**, allowing deeper reasoning when needed.
- Instruction compliance is improved, making it more reliable in complex workflows.

### Agent & Long-Running Task Capabilities

- Sonnet 4.5 is tailored for building **autonomous agents** that can execute multi-step workflows over prolonged durations.
- It features improved **tool handling**—able to orchestrate multiple tools in parallel during tasks.
- Better **context awareness** ensures the model tracks its own token usage and prevents loss of context in long conversations.
- It supports **automatic clearing of tool history** when memory limits or conversation length would otherwise cause inefficiencies.
- Through advanced **context management APIs**, the model can preserve coherence across long sessions.

### API & Interaction Enhancements

- The Bedrock API introduces **smart context window management**: when conversation length approaches model limits, the model returns up to its capacity and gives a clear stop reason.
- **Tool use clearing logic** helps reclaim token space by purging or compressing older tool interactions while retaining usefulness.
- Sonnet 4.5 adds a distinct `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason to explicitly indicate termination due to context size bounds.
- It also fixes parameter formatting bugs—for example, trailing newlines in tool parameters are now preserved correctly.

## Use Cases & Industry Applications

Sonnet 4.5 is designed to deliver real business impact across domains:

- **Cybersecurity**: deploy agents that proactively patch vulnerabilities or respond to incidents.
- **Finance & Audit**: support tasks from data analysis to predictive modeling or audit assistance.
- **Enterprise Automation**: orchestrate cross-system workflows, marketing campaigns, or internal processes.
- **Software Development**: act as an AI “colleague” for programmers, assisting on design, refactoring, tests, and more.

---

## Getting Started in Amazon Bedrock

- Users can access Sonnet 4.5 via Bedrock using the designated model identifier.
- The **Bedrock Converse API** makes it easier to switch between foundation models in code with minimal changes.
- Developers can combine Sonnet 4.5 with **AgentCore**, Bedrock’s infrastructure for building agentic systems—benefiting from session isolation, observability, and multi-hour support.
- Leverage features such as extended thinking and context clearing to optimize usage and costs.

---

## Availability, Pricing & Compatibility

- Sonnet 4.5 is accessible across multiple AWS regions via cross-region inference.
- It joins the existing Claude models in Bedrock (e.g. Claude 4) as part of Anthropic’s model offerings.
- The model balances performance, cost, and speed to support high-volume production use.
- It also appears on Anthropic’s own API endpoints and is integrated into platforms like Google’s Vertex AI in supported regions.

## Conclusion

Claude Sonnet 4.5 marks a significant milestone in bridging strong coding intelligence with sustained agentic capabilities. Through Amazon Bedrock, it becomes more accessible to organizations aiming to build complex, autonomous workflows without heavy infrastructure overhead.

For teams building advanced agents, Sonnet 4.5 offers:

- Superior coding & reasoning performance
- Reliable long-horizon task handling
- Better tool orchestration and context management
- Seamless integration with enterprise AI pipelines via Bedrock
