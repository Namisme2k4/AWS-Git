# Optimizing Metrics Ingestion with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

## Overview

As organizations scale their observability systems, handling metrics efficiently becomes critical for reliability, performance, and cost optimization. This article introduces how Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) enables enterprises to optimize ingestion pipelines, monitor quotas, and protect workloads through label-based active series limits.

## Context and Challenges

### Current State

- Modern enterprises run multiple workloads across AWS accounts and regions.
- Metrics ingestion volumes can easily grow into millions of active time series.
- Without proper controls, “noisy neighbors” can degrade performance and increase costs.

### Key Challenges

- Centralizing metrics ingestion at scale.
- Monitoring ingestion quotas effectively.
- Protecting critical workloads from runaway or misconfigured agents.
- Balancing flexibility with predictability and cost control.

---

## AWS’s Core Principles for Optimized Ingestion

### Principle 1: Centralized Observability

**Core Philosophy:**

- Consolidating metrics across accounts provides a unified observability plane.
- Managed collectors and secure cross-account roles simplify ingestion pipelines.

**Solution:**

- AMP workspaces act as centralized endpoints for scraping and storing metrics.
- Cross-account ingestion with IAM roles ensures security and scalability.

---

### Principle 2: Monitor Quotas and Usage

**Fundamentals:**

- AMP defines quotas for ingestion rate, active series, and query concurrency.
- CloudWatch metrics expose detailed usage insights.

**Key Metrics:**

- `IngestionRate`: samples per second.
- `ActiveSeries`: number of active time series.
- `DiscardedSamples`: number of rejected samples.
- Rule evaluation and query TPS metrics for additional visibility.

---

### Principle 3: Control with Label-Based Active Series Limits

**Evolved Capabilities:**

- Introduced label-based limits to isolate noisy workloads.
- Limits apply per label set (e.g., `app="payment-service", environment="prod"`).
- Prevents a single service from overwhelming the entire workspace.

**Benefits:**

- Protects mission-critical workloads.
- Improves cost predictability.
- Encourages better metric hygiene and label design.

---

### Principle 4: Observability and Governance per Label Set

**Enhancements:**

- CloudWatch metrics now expose ingestion data at label-set granularity.
- Key metrics:
  - `ActiveSeriesPerLabelSet`
  - `IngestionRatePerLabelSet`
  - `DiscardedSamplesPerLabelSet` (with rejection reasons)

**Outcome:**

- Teams can identify which workloads generate the most overhead.
- Provides data for tuning label limits and refining observability practices.

---

## Key Features and Services

### Label-Based Limits

- Fine-grained control over active time series.
- Configurable via AWS Console or CLI.
- Default limits for workloads outside defined label sets.

### Managed Collectors

- Secure, scalable scrapers managed by AWS.
- Support external labels to align ingestion with label-set governance.

### CloudWatch Integration

- Pre-built metrics for ingestion health.
- Enables dashboards, alarms, and automated responses.

---

## Real-World Results

### Customer Outcomes

- **Enterprise observability teams**: Reduced risk of ingestion overload.
- **Multi-account environments**: Simplified cross-account metrics collection.
- **Operations teams**: Improved visibility into cost drivers and workload health.

### Example Benefits

- Shielded production services from noisy test workloads.
- Reduced cost by tuning high-cardinality metrics.
- Achieved consistent ingestion performance at scale.

---

## Action Recommendations

### Key Advice

- Establish central AMP workspaces for observability at scale.
- Continuously monitor quotas and ingestion metrics via CloudWatch.
- Configure label-based limits to isolate workloads and enforce governance.

### Implementation Strategy

1. Define external labels for each workload or account.
2. Set label-based limits aligned to business criticality.
3. Monitor discarded samples and investigate noisy metrics.
4. Automate alerts and dashboards to ensure early detection.

## Conclusion

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus provides the necessary tools to scale observability without sacrificing reliability or cost efficiency. With centralized ingestion, quota monitoring, and label-based governance, organizations can protect mission-critical workloads, prevent noisy neighbors, and maintain predictable performance as observability needs grow.
