# Measuring the Accuracy of Rule or ML-based Matching in AWS Entity Resolution

Organizations often maintain customer, product, or patient data across multiple systems. To build a unified view, it is essential to **match records** that refer to the same entity. A common challenge is ensuring that the chosen matching approach — **rule-based** or **machine learning (ML)-based** — provides sufficient accuracy.

This post explains how to evaluate and measure accuracy within **AWS Entity Resolution**, helping teams validate whether their chosen strategy meets business and compliance needs.

## Why Accuracy Matters

Accurate entity matching directly impacts downstream use cases:

- **Customer 360**: Building a complete customer profile
- **Fraud detection**: Identifying duplicate or synthetic identities
- **Healthcare**: Linking patient records without compromising privacy
- **Marketing**: Ensuring correct personalization and segmentation

A poor matching strategy can lead to **false positives** (different entities incorrectly linked) or **false negatives** (same entity missed).

## Rule-based vs ML-based Matching

- **Rule-based matching**  
  Uses deterministic rules (e.g., exact match on email + fuzzy match on name).

  - Easy to understand and explain
  - Works well when data is standardized
  - Limited flexibility for variations in data

- **ML-based matching**  
  Uses models trained to learn similarities across attributes.
  - Handles messy, inconsistent, or incomplete data better
  - Improves accuracy over time
  - Requires labeled data for evaluation

## Measuring Accuracy in AWS Entity Resolution

AWS Entity Resolution provides built-in tools to help measure accuracy of both approaches:

1. **Precision** – proportion of correctly matched records among all matches.
2. **Recall** – proportion of actual matches that were correctly identified.
3. **F1 Score** – harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Workflow for Evaluation

1. Define a **validation dataset** with ground truth labels.
2. Run matching using either rule-based or ML-based configuration.
3. Compare output matches against ground truth.
4. Review metrics (precision, recall, F1) to decide if adjustments are needed.

## Best Practices

- Start with a **representative dataset** for testing.
- Iterate and refine rules or ML models based on accuracy results.
- Use **explainability features** (especially with ML) to build trust.
- Continuously monitor and re-evaluate as new data sources are added.

## Conclusion

Measuring accuracy is essential to selecting the right matching strategy in AWS Entity Resolution. Whether you choose **rule-based simplicity** or **ML-based adaptability**, tracking metrics like precision, recall, and F1 ensures the solution supports reliable analytics and decision-making across industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail.
