## Context and Challenges

### Current State

- Intelligent agent systems are already beginning to solve complex problems, automate workflows, and create new possibilities across industries
- Early success from AstraZeneca, Yahoo Finance, Syngenta
- Need for a practical approach that addresses the inherent complexity of agentic systems

### Key Challenges

- Moving beyond experiments to production-ready agent systems
- Addressing the inherent complexity of agentic systems
- Balancing flexibility with enterprise reliability

## AWS's 4 Core Principles

### Principle 1: Embrace agility as a competitive edge

**Core Philosophy:**

- Organizations that thrive won't be those who perfectly predict the future, but those who adapt quickly as it unfolds
- Building agentic architecture that embraces flexibility and openness rather than rigid frameworks

**Solution: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**

- A complete set of services for deploying and operating highly capable agents securely at enterprise scale
- Secure, serverless runtime with complete session isolation
- Compatible with open source frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- Early adopters: Ita√∫ Unibanco, Innovaccer, Boomi, Box, Epsilon

### Principle 2: Evolve fundamentals for the agentic era

**Evolved Fundamentals:**

**A. Security and Trust**

- AgentCore Runtime addresses these with dedicated compute environments per session and memory isolation that helps prevent data leaks across agents
- Transparency, guardrails, and verification

**B. Reliability and Scalability**

- Checkpointing and recovery capabilities for graceful recovery
- Automatically handle scaling from zero to thousands of concurrent sessions
- Eliminates capacity planning and infrastructure maintenance

**C. Identity**

- AgentCore Identity delivers secure agent access with temporary, fine-grained permissions
- Integrates with Amazon Cognito, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta
- OAuth providers: GitHub, Google, Salesforce, Slack

**D. Observability**

- Observability becomes essential not just for troubleshooting, but for compliance and continuous improvement
- Real-time visibility through built-in dashboards
- Standardized telemetry integration

**E. Data**

- AgentCore Gateway transforms data sources including Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases into agent-compatible tools
- Enables agents to access recent and relevant information

**F. Seamless Integration**

- AgentCore Gateway makes it possible by transforming APIs and services into agent-compatible tools with minimal code
- AWS API MCP Server gives agents a callable interface to AWS services

**G. Tooling and Capabilities**

- AgentCore Memory: manages both short-term and long-term memory
- AgentCore Browser: enables web interactions
- AgentCore Code Interpreter: executes code securely

### Principle 3: Deliver superior outcomes with model choice and data

**Model Diversity:**

- No single model excels across all dimensions, which is why we pioneered model choice with Amazon Bedrock in 2023

**New Customization Capabilities:**

- **Amazon Nova customization in Amazon SageMaker AI**:
  - Pre-training and post-training capabilities
  - Fine-tuning and alignment
  - PEFT and full fine-tuning support
  - SFT, DPO, PPO, CPT, Knowledge Distillation
- **Nova Act**: AI model trained to perform actions within a web browser
- **Amazon S3 Vectors**: Reduces vector storage costs by 90% while maintaining sub-second query performance

### Principle 4: Deploy solutions that transform experiences

**Marketplace and Solutions:**

- AI Agents and Tools in AWS Marketplace with flexible deployment options
- **Kiro**: AI IDE for spec-driven development
- **AWS Transform**: automates complex modernization tasks
- **Amazon Connect**: unlimited AI on every customer interaction
