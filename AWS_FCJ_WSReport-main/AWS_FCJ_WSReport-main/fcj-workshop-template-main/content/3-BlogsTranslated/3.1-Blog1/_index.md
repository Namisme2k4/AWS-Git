# Amazon ECS IPv6-only Support: Expanding Container Networking

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) now supports running workloads **exclusively on IPv6**, allowing you to deploy containerized applications in IPv6 environments without relying on IPv4. This feature helps simplify networking, reduce operational costs, and meet compliance requirements as IPv4 addresses become increasingly scarce.

---

## Capabilities with IPv6-only on ECS

With IPv6-only configuration, ECS tasks can:

- Run in IPv6-only subnets without dual-stack requirements.
- Integrate with PrivateLink and IPv6-enabled VPC endpoints.
- Use security groups and VPC Flow Logs with IPv6 traffic.
- Communicate with AWS services such as ECR, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, and Parameter Store.
- Operate in networking modes like awsvpc, bridge, and host, just as with IPv4.

## Configuring IPv6-only Networking

To deploy ECS with IPv6-only networking, you need to:

1. **Prepare VPC and subnets**

   - Assign IPv6 CIDR to the VPC.
   - Create IPv6-only subnets.
   - Enable automatic IPv6 assignment.

2. **Configure security**

   - Allow IPv6 traffic in security groups.
   - Open ICMPv6 for Neighbor Discovery.
   - Route IPv6 traffic through Internet Gateway or Egress-Only Internet Gateway.

3. **Create IPv6 target group for load balancers**

   - Use ALB or NLB with IPv6 target groups.
   - Configure health checks for IPv6 endpoints.

4. **Deploy ECS service**
   - Launch tasks in IPv6-only subnets using the awsvpc mode.
   - ECS automatically assigns IPv6 addresses, registers targets, and integrates with service discovery.

## Integration with Other AWS Services

- **ECR**: Container images are pulled via dual-stack endpoints when running in IPv6-only.
- **Service Discovery & ECS Service Connect**: Supports AAAA records and IPv6 communication between services within or across VPCs.
- **Storage & Databases**: ECS tasks can connect to services like S3, EFS, RDS, and Aurora where IPv6 is supported.
- **IPv4-only Services**: Use DNS64/NAT64 to translate IPv6 traffic to IPv4.

---

## Migration Strategies to IPv6-only

- For services without load balancers: update subnets and security groups to IPv6 directly.
- For services with load balancers: deploy a parallel IPv6-only service and gradually shift traffic.
- Use weighted target groups or DNS-based routing to manage transitions.
- Monitor migration using CloudWatch, application logs, and VPC Flow Logs before decommissioning IPv4 services.

## Conclusion

The **IPv6-only** capability in Amazon ECS offers key advantages:

- Eliminates dependency on IPv4.
- Simplifies container networking configurations.
- Meets IPv6 compliance requirements.
- Maintains seamless integration with AWS services.

Adopting IPv6-only networking helps organizations future-proof their infrastructure and ensure scalability for years to come.
