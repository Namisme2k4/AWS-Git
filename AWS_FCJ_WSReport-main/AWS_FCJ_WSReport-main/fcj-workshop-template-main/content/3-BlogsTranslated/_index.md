### [Blog 1 - AWS AI Agents Production-Ready at Scale](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog highlights how customers can build production-ready AI agents at scale. It introduces four guiding principles: flexibility (supporting multiple models and data), strengthening fundamentals (security, reliability, observability), leveraging the right data and models, and focusing on transformative business outcomes.

Key launches include Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (secure, serverless runtime), Nova in SageMaker (model customization), Nova Act SDK (web task automation), S3 Vectors (low-cost, high-performance vector storage), and a rich agent marketplace. AWS advises starting with meaningful small use cases and expanding, supported by the Generative AI Innovation Center.

### [Blog 2 - Optimizing metrics ingestion with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](3.2-Blog2/)

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) helps optimize metrics ingestion at scale. The blog highlights monitoring key ingestion metrics (IngestionRate, ActiveSeries…), setting per-label set limits to prevent a single app from overloading the system, and configuring quotas via console/CLI. New CloudWatch metrics like ActiveSeriesPerLabelSet and IngestionRatePerLabelSet enable detailed monitoring. This approach helps organizations control costs, prioritize critical metrics, and maintain system stability.
