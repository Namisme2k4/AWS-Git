### [Blog 1 - AWS AI Agents Production-Ready at Scale](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog highlights how customers can build production-ready AI agents at scale. It introduces four guiding principles: flexibility (supporting multiple models and data), strengthening fundamentals (security, reliability, observability), leveraging the right data and models, and focusing on transformative business outcomes.

Key launches include Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (secure, serverless runtime), Nova in SageMaker (model customization), Nova Act SDK (web task automation), S3 Vectors (low-cost, high-performance vector storage), and a rich agent marketplace. AWS advises starting with meaningful small use cases and expanding, supported by the Generative AI Innovation Center.

### [Blog 2 - Optimizing metrics ingestion with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](3.2-Blog2/)

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) helps optimize metrics ingestion at scale. The blog highlights monitoring key ingestion metrics (IngestionRate, ActiveSeries…), setting per-label set limits to prevent a single app from overloading the system, and configuring quotas via console/CLI. New CloudWatch metrics like ActiveSeriesPerLabelSet and IngestionRatePerLabelSet enable detailed monitoring. This approach helps organizations control costs, prioritize critical metrics, and maintain system stability.

### [Blog 3 - Simplifying Log Management using Amazon CloudWatch Logs Centralization](3.3-Blog3/)

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) enables enterprises to optimize metrics ingestion as observability systems scale. The article highlights four key principles: (1) centralized observability through shared AMP workspaces, (2) monitoring quotas and usage with CloudWatch, (3) enforcing label-based active series limits to isolate noisy workloads, and (4) governance at label-set granularity. AMP provides managed collectors, CloudWatch integration, and fine-grained label-based controls, ensuring mission-critical workloads are protected from misconfigured or runaway agents. These capabilities improve cost predictability, enforce metric hygiene, and maintain stable ingestion performance at scale. Real-world outcomes show enterprises reduced overload risks, simplified multi-account collection, improved visibility into cost drivers, and shielded production services from test workloads.

### [Blog 4 - ...](3.4-Blog4/)

This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article also guides you through the steps to set up the environment, organize the data processing pipeline, and ensure compliance with security & privacy standards such as HIPAA.

### [Blog 5 - ...](3.5-Blog5/)
